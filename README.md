## Configure Settings Sync

Settings Sync Configuration page will be opened automatically on code start and requires two things to setup:

1. GitHub token
2. GitHub gist ID

GitHub token needs to be retrieved by your GitHub account while Settings Sync creates a gist if you are first time user.

Follow these steps to configure:

- Click on `Login with GitHub`.
- Login to GitHub in the browser and close the browser tab once you get the success message.
- If you are using Settings Sync for the first time, a gist will be created automatically when you upload your settings.
- If you already have a GitHub gist, a new window will be opened to allow you to select the GitHub gist or `Skip` to create a new gist.

You can always **verify the created gist** by going to `https://gist.github.com` and checking for a gist named `cloudSettings`.


## Upload Your Settings

**Press `Shift` + `Alt` + `U`** (macOS: `Shift` + `Option` + `U`)

> Select **">Sync: Update/Upload Settings"** in the Command Palette to upload your settings.

When downloading or uploading for the first time, the welcome page will automatically open, where you can configure the Settings Sync.

Once you select upload, after uploading the settings, you will see a summary containing a list of each of the files and extensions uploaded.

I recommend that you read the configurations details [here](https://dev.to/shanalikhan/visual-studio-code-settings-sync-configurations-mn0).


### Gist Settings

Gist settings are stored in the `settings.json` file of Code.

You can customize gist settings as follows:

1. Configure gist ID (environment)
2. Configure auto upload / download for GitHub gist
3. Configure extension sync behaviour
4. Configure force download
5. Configure force upload
6. Configure quiet sync

```json
    "sync.gist": "0c929b1a6c51015cdc9e0fe2e369ea4c",
    "sync.autoDownload": false,
    "sync.autoUpload": false,
    "sync.forceDownload": false,
    "sync.forceUpload": false,
    "sync.quietSync": false,
    "sync.sortAlphabetically": false,
    "sync.removeExtensions": true,
    "sync.syncExtensions": true
```

### Global Settings


Global settings are stored in `syncLocalSettings.json` inside the `User` folder. These settings will be shared across multiple gist environments.

You can customize the sync as follows:


1. Options by which files / folders and settings to exclude from upload.
2. Configure default gist environment name.
3. Replace the code settings after downloading.
4. Change the gist description while creating new one in GitHub.
5. Configure GitHub Enterprise Url.

```json
{
  "ignoreUploadFiles": [
    "state.*",
    "syncLocalSettings.json",
    ".DS_Store",
    "sync.lock",
    "projects.json",
    "projects_cache_vscode.json",
    "projects_cache_git.json",
    "projects_cache_svn.json",
    "gpm_projects.json",
    "gpm-recentItems.json"
  ],
  "ignoreUploadFolders": ["workspaceStorage"],
  "ignoreExtensions": [],
  "gistDescription": "Visual Studio Code Settings Sync Gist",
  "version": 340,
  "token": "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN",
  "downloadPublicGist": false,
  "supportedFileExtensions": ["json", "code-snippets"],
  "openTokenLink": true,

}
```


I recommend you read the configurations details [here](https://dev.to/shanalikhan/visual-studio-code-settings-sync-configurations-mn0).

## Features

### Toggle Auto-Upload on change

Auto-Upload is **disabled by default**. When the settings are changed and saved this feature will automatically start the upload process and save the settings online.

Please make sure you have a valid GitHub token and gist available to make it work properly.

> Select **"Sync: Advanced Options > Toggle Auto-Upload on Settings Change"** in the Command Palette to turn Auto-Upload ON / OFF.

### Toggle Auto Download

Auto-Download is **disabled by default**. It will sync all the setting by default when the editor starts.
Please make sure you have a valid GitHub token and gist available to make it work properly.

> Select **"Sync: Advanced Options > Toggle Auto-Download On Startup"** in the Command Palette to turn Auto-Download ON / OFF.

### Toggle Force Download

Force Download is **disabled by default**. By default, the extension won't download the latest settings if you already have the latest version downloaded, but sometimes when you delete an extension locally and don't upload the settings it will still show that you have the latest versions by date or time checks, by turning this ON it will always download the cloud settings on startup.

Please make sure you have a valid GitHub token and gist available to make it work properly.

> Select **"Sync: Advanced Options > Toggle Force Download"** in the Command Palette to turn  Force Download ON / OFF.

### Toggle Force Upload

Force Upload is **disabled by default**. By default, this extension won't upload the settings if the gist has newer or identical content. By turning this ON it will always upload without checking for newer settings in the gist.

Please make sure you have a valid GitHub token and gist available to make it work properly.

> Select **"Sync: Advanced Options > Toggle Force Upload"** in the Command Palette to turn Force Upload ON / OFF.

### Toggle Summary

Summary is **enabled by default**. It shows all files and extensions that are added or deleted on a single page.
You may turn it off in order to make the upload and download processes clean and quiet.


> Select **"Sync: Advanced Options > Show Summary Page On Upload / Download"** in the Command Palette to turn Auto Download ON / OFF.


### Custom Sync

Settings Sync allows you to sync the files other from `User` folder. For example, your workspace settings and much more. It's upon you to utilize the full potential of Settings Sync across your machines or your team's machines. Read about custom sync [here](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync/wiki/Custom-Sync).

### Sync Pragmas

You can even manage which settings you want to ignore from being uploaded or downloaded. Settings Sync even allows you to manage your `home` and `office` computer specific settings, even OS related settings, in a single GitHub gist. Read details about [Sync Pragmas here](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync/wiki/Sync-Pragmas).

### Share Settings Across Teams & Users

If you are looking to share your settings. Read the details [here](https://dev.to/shanalikhan/how-to-share-your-visual-studio-code-settings-and-extensions-39k). Settings Sync needs to create new public GitHub gist to share your settings with other users.
